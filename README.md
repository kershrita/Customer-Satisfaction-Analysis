# Customer Satisfaction Analysis

The Customer Satisfaction Analysis Model is a machine learning solution designed to analyze customer feedback data and determine the level of customer satisfaction. It aims to provide insights into customer sentiments and help businesses understand and improve their customer experience.

Understanding customer satisfaction is crucial for businesses to identify areas of improvement and enhance customer experience. This ML model leverages natural language processing and sentiment analysis techniques to analyze customer feedback data. By training on labeled data, the model learns to classify customer sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Installation

To get started with the Customer Satisfaction Analysis ML Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone or Download the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/kershrita/Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis.git
```
2. Install the necessary libraries:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib nltk scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Prepare the labeled customer feedback dataset for training. Ensure that the dataset is properly formatted and labeled with corresponding sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral).
2. Preprocess the text data by applying techniques such as tokenization, removing stop words, and lemmatization. This step helps to clean and normalize the text data.
3. Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the ML model's performance.
4. Select a suitable machine learning algorithm, such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or RNN, and train the model using the training dataset.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using the testing dataset by calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict the sentiment of new customer feedback data using [Customer Satisfaction Predictor](Customer%20Satisfaction%20Predictor.ipynb).

## Features

- **Sentiment Classification**: The ML model classifies customer feedback into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, allowing businesses to gauge overall customer satisfaction levels.
- **Text Preprocessing**: The model performs text preprocessing techniques, such as tokenization, removing stop words, and lemmatization, to prepare the text data for analysis.
- **Performance Metrics**: The model calculates performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to evaluate the effectiveness of the sentiment analysis predictions.
- **Model Evaluation**: The Customer Satisfaction Analysis ML Model's performance can be evaluated using various metrics, including:
	- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall accuracy of the model's predictions by calculating the percentage of correctly classified sentiments.
	- **Precision**: Indicates the proportion of correctly predicted positive or negative sentiments out of the total predicted positive or negative sentiments.
	- **Recall**: Represents the proportion of correctly predicted positive or negative sentiments out of the total actual positive or negative sentiments.
	- **F1-score**: Combines precision and recall into a single metric to provide a balanced evaluation of the model's performance.

## Configuration

The Customer Satisfaction Analysis ML Model can be utilized in various ways:

- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Use the model to analyze customer feedback data in real-time and gain insights into customer sentiments.
- **Customer Support Improvement**: Identify areas for improvement based on customer sentiment analysis results and take actions to enhance customer support and satisfaction.
- **Product/Service Enhancement**: Analyze customer sentiments to understand their experiences with specific products or services and make improvements accordingly.
- **Marketing Campaigns**: Evaluate the success and impact of marketing campaigns by analyzing customer feedback sentiments and adjusting strategies accordingly.
